Redirect To Any Tab
===================
See original blog post http://nerdyaffiliate.com/affiliate-marketing/prosper202-modification-redirect-to-any-tab

Edit 202-config/template.php to change redirect time and tab to redirect to:

$refreshtime = "2";
$tab_page = "2a";

Read template.php for a list of tabs codes.

Set Currency Symbol
====================

You can now set the currency symbol used in reports and a couple of other places. See 202-config-sample.php.

Deep Linking
============

If your affiliate link allows your to specify a custom deep link then you'll find this feature very useful.

If your affiliate link looks like:

http://merchant.com/?&aff=xx&some-deep-link-param=[[deeplink]]

'some-deep-link-param' might be 'p', 'url' or something else.

Setup your campaign with the [[deeplink]] placeholder.

You can then generate destination URLs in '#7 Get Links' with a deep link of your choosing.

e.g. http://proper202site.com/tracking202/redirect/dl.php?t202id=xx&t202kw=&deeplink=[add your deep link here]

You can also just append the deep links on programmatically or within a spreadsheet. Happy Days!
